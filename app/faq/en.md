# Frequently Asked Questions

## About Peeranha

### What is Peeranha?

Peeranha is a decentralized knowledge-sharing protocol for Web3 where communities truly own their knowledge and earned reputation. Peeranha is built on a blockchain and it is owned by the community rather than by a single organization.

<!-- ### How is Peeranha different from other question and answer websites?

Unlike other question and answer websites where an organization owns the website and all the data generated from users, Peeranha is owned by the community and rewards are distributed to community members for their contributions. -->

### How does it work?

Peeranha is built using smart contracts on the Polygon blockchain. Large content is stored via distributed storage (IPFS) and only hashes of all documents are posted on the blockchain to save expensive blockchain storage. Reputation, privileges, moderation, rewards and all other rules are built into smart contracts and are visible to anyone.

<!-- ### Where do tokens for rewards come from?

Peeranha continually creates new tokens once a week until the total supply of tokens is reached. For a currency, this is known as inflation. Every week, newly created tokens are transferred to the reward pool. This weekly reward pool is distributed proportionally across users who contributed to the community during the week. -->

### What Blockchain is Peeranha built on?

Peeranha is powered by Polygon blockchain. Polygon provides short confirmation times for transactions and does not require users to pay any transaction fees.

<!-- ### What is the cryptocurrency of Peeranha?

Peeranha uses its own crypto-token (or cryptocurrency) called PEER.

### How can I earn crypto tokens on Peeranha?

All activities on the protocol that are considered valuable for the community are rewarded in PEER tokens. Contributions that earn tokens may include posting a detailed question, providing a helpful answer or acting as a moderator. -->

## Token

### What is the name of token on Peeranha?

PEER

### Is PEER listed on any exchange?

No, PEER is not listed on any exchange yet. We will notify the community as soon as this happens.

### What is total supply?

The total supply of the PEER token is 1 000 000 000 PEER

### What is the token allocation?

- 60% of PEER will be created by emission and used as initial rewards to users for their contributions
- 20% for founders and team rewards
- 20% for funding

### What is the emission rate?

New tokens are created once per week. The maximum starting emission is 1 000 000 PEER per week (depends on user activity). The emission is reduced by 7% every 52 weeks.

### Period

Peeranha distributes PEER token rewards to its users in periods. The number of periods is not limited. 
Each period is one week long. You can check the current period in your wallet.  
Click the Wallet button > check current period in progress.
<img src='../images/period_2.svg' alt style="display:block; width: 200px; height: 120px; border:1px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 30%)">
<img src='../images/period_1.svg' alt style="display:block; width: 200px; height: 120px; border:1px solid rgb(0 0 0 / 30%)">
User reward in PEER tokens depends on the number of reputation points received during the particular period. The more active you are, the more tokens you get.
  
_Note: Token is not launched as of now. We are working hard to speed up this process. The estimated reward will be available for you to claim after the token launch. Stay active on Peeranha. Thank you!_

## Rewards

### When are rewards paid out?

![](../images/rulesFAQ.svg)

Rewards are paid out weekly.

To prevent abuse of the system, there is a safety period of one additional week before rewards are available for users.

For example:

- Week 1: users engage on site
- Week 2: rewards are allocated but not distributed
- Week 3: rewards from week 1’s contributions are distributed estimated rewards for week 1 will be visible after the start of week 2 but available to be received only after the start of week 3.

<!--### How are user rewards calculated?

Exact user rewards depends on the user activity during a given period. The maximum size of the weekly reward pool is equal to maximum weekly emission of the token.

If total rating points earned by all of the users during the week multiplied by 10 is less than maximum token emission, then the reward is simply 10 PEERs per rating point.

Otherwise, the reward pool size is equal to the maximum weekly token emission and tokens are distributed proportionally to rating points earned by users.-->

## Boost

### What is a Boost?

Boost is a multiplier of the common PEER token reward that users are getting by increasing their rating points on Peeranha. The multiplier value depends on the User’s token investment amount called Stake. The highest Stake on Peeranha will give its owner the biggest Boost multiplier – X4. Other users, who made a lower Stake, compared to maximum stake, will get the calculated Boost multiplier according to their Stake.

### How to make a stake?

To make a stake, navigate to the Boost page from the wallet drop-down menu and fill the “Your Stake” form. Boost will be activated in the next period. Staked PEER tokens will be frozen and out of use until you unstake them.
The stake will always migrate from one period to another unless it is changed or withdrawn. Changes to the stake can be made anytime, but they will be applied in the next period.

### Why are my tokens frozen?

It's made to use these tokens as additional capital for the founding needs. This system works like bank deposits.

To unlock the tokens, withdraw the Stake and in the next period the staked tokens will be returned, and Boost will be deactivated.

### When I can get my reward?

The reward with Boost is paid out to users with the same rules as a common reward. Learn more about it in FAQ “Rewards” section
