# Frequently Asked Questions

## About Peeranha

### What is Peeranha?

Peeranha is a decentralized question and answer website that rewards users with crypto tokens (PEER) for their valuable contributions. Peeranha is built on a blockchain and it is owned by the community rather than by a single organization.

### How is Peeranha different from other question and answer websites?

Unlike other question and answer websites where an organization owns the website and all the data generated from users, Peeranha is owned by the community and rewards are distributed to community members for their contributions.

### How does it work?

Peeranha is built using smart contracts on the Telos blockchain. Large content is stored via distributed storage (IPFS) and only hashes of all documents are posted on the blockchain to save expensive blockchain storage. Reputation, privileges, moderation, rewards and all other rules are built into smart contracts and are visible to anyone.

### Where do tokens for rewards come from?

Peeranha continually creates new tokens once a week until the total supply of tokens is reached. For a currency, this is known as inflation. Every week, newly created tokens are transferred to the reward pool. This weekly reward pool is distributed proportionally across users who contributed to the community during the week.

### What Blockchain is Peeranha built on?

Peeranha is powered by Telos blockchain. Telos provides short confirmation times for transactions and does not require users to pay any transaction fees.

### What is the cryptocurrency of Peeranha?

Peeranha uses its own crypto-token (or cryptocurrency) called PEER.

### How can I earn crypto tokens on Peeranha?

All activities on the website that are considered valuable for the community are rewarded in PEER tokens. Contributions that earn tokens may include posting a detailed question, providing a helpful answer or acting as a moderator.

## Account

### Are my keys safe if I sign up with email? 

We believe that you should be the only one who has access to your private keys. Centralized servers are a single point of failure and a potential risk of mass hacks of user accounts.

Peeranha will transport and store your privates keys only in encrypted format.

If you create a new account, then your private keys are generated inside the application on your device. 

Two encrypted copies of your keys are sent to Peeranha’s API and saved in our database:
- The first copy is encrypted using your password and used when you normally use the account;
- The second copy is encrypted using your Master key and used to recover access to the account in case if you forget the password.

**It is very important to save your Master Key in a safe place. We will not be able to restore access to your account if your Master Key is lost.**

When accessing your account, encrypted keys are sent to the application and decrypted inside the application using your password or Master Key.

### Can I sign up with email if I already have a Telos account?

Yes you can. You will need to provide at least your active key for your account. However, we will never transport or store your key unencrypted. The key will be encrypted using your password and Master Key in the application and only after it is encrypted it is sent to our API.

### Can I delete my Peeranha account?

You will be able to delete your Peeranha wallet account (keys store) at any time if you choose the option to sign up using your email address. However, it is not possible to delete your Telos account from the blockchain after it is created.

### What is my Master Key?

Your Master Key is required to restore access to your account if you forget your password.

**It is very important to save Master Key in a safe place. We will not be able to restore access to your account if your Master Key is lost.**

## Token

### What is the name of token on Peeranha?

PEER

### Is PEER listed on any exchange?

No, PEER is not listed on any exchange yet. We will notify the community as soon as this happens.

### What is total supply?

The total supply of the PEER token is 100,000,000 PEER

### What is the token allocation?

* 60% of PEER will be created by emission and used as initial rewards to users for their contributions
* 20% for founders and team rewards
* 20% for funding


### What is emission rate?

New tokens are created once per week. The maximum starting emission is 100,000 PEER per week (depends on user activity). The emission is reduced by 10% every 52 weeks.

## Rewards

### When are rewards paid out?

Rewards are paid out weekly, starting from Peeranha’s launch date on December 16th, 2019. 

To prevent abuse of the system, there is a  safety period of one additional week before rewards are available for users. 

For example:
* Week 1: users engage on site 
* Week 2: rewards are allocated but not distributed 
* Week 3: rewards from week 1’s contributions are distributed  estimated rewards for week 1 will be visible after the start of week 2 but available to be received only after the start of week 3.


### How are user rewards calculated?

Exact user rewards depends on the user activity during a given period. The maximum size of the weekly reward pool is equal to maximum weekly emission of the token. 

If total rating points earned by all of the users during the week multiplied by 10 is less than maximum token emission, then the reward is simply 10 PEERs per rating point. 

Otherwise, the reward pool size is equal to the maximum weekly token emission and tokens are distributed proportionally to rating points earned by users.
