# Frequently Asked Questions

## About Peeranha

### What is Peeranha?

Peeranha is a decentralized question and answer website that rewards users with crypto tokens (PEER) for their valuable contributions. Peeranha is built on a blockchain and it is owned by the community rather than by a single organization.

### How is Peeranha different from other questions and answers websites?

Unlike other question and answer websites where an organization owns the website and all the data generated from users, Peeranha is owned by the community and rewards are distributed to community members for their contributions and the attention they give to the website.

### How does it work?

Peeranha is built using smart contracts on the Telos blockchain. Large content is stored via distributed storage (IPFS) and only hashes of all documents are posted on the blockchain to save expensive blockchain storage. Reputation, privileges, moderation, rewards and all other rules are built into smart contracts and are visible to anyone.

### Where do tokens for rewards come from?

Peeranha continually creates new tokens once a week until the total supply of tokens is reached. For a currency, this is known as inflation. Every week, newly created tokens are transferred to the reward pool. This weekly reward pool is distributed proportionally to usersâ€™ contributions to the community during the week. As the website and community grow, additional sources begin to contribute tokens to the weekly reward pool. Such sources can be fees for the ads and job postings published on the website, donations, or other ways that the community decides to monetize the website. The rate of new token creation reduces every year and eventually decreases to zero. At this point, the weekly reward pool will solely consist of tokens monetized by the website.

### What Blockchain Peeranha is built on?

Peeranha is powered by TELOS blockchain. TELOS provides short confirmation times for transactions and does not require users to pay any transaction fees.

### What is the cryptocurrency of Peeranha?

Peeranha uses its own crypto-token (or cryptocurrency) called PEER.

### How can I earn crypto tokens on Peeranha?

All activities on the website that are considered valuable for the community are rewarded in crypto tokens. Contributions that earn tokens may include posting a detailed question, providing a helpful answer and participating in moderation.

If create new account, then private keys are generated inside the application on your device. 

Two encrypted copies of your keys are sent to Peeranha API and saved in our database:
- The first copy is encrypted using your password and used when you normally use the account;
- The second copy is encrypted using your Master key and used to recover access to the account in case if you forget the password.

**It is very important to save Master Key in a safe place. We will not be able to restore access to your account if Master Key is lost.**

When access account, encrypted keys are sent to application and decrypted inside the application using your password or Master Key.
