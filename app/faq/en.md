# Frequently Asked Questions

## About Peeranha

### What is Peeranha?

Peeranha is a decentralized question and answer website that rewards users with crypto tokens (PEER) for their valuable contributions. Peeranha is built on a blockchain and it is owned by the community rather than by a single organization.

### How is Peeranha different from other questions and answers websites?

Unlike other question and answer websites where an organization owns the website and all the data generated from users, Peeranha is owned by the community and rewards are distributed to community members for their contributions and the attention they give to the website.

### How does it work?

Peeranha is built using smart contracts on the Telos blockchain. Large content is stored via distributed storage (IPFS) and only hashes of all documents are posted on the blockchain to save expensive blockchain storage. Reputation, privileges, moderation, rewards and all other rules are built into smart contracts and are visible to anyone.

### Where do tokens for rewards come from?

Peeranha continually creates new tokens once a week until the total supply of tokens is reached. For a currency, this is known as inflation. Every week, newly created tokens are transferred to the reward pool. This weekly reward pool is distributed proportionally to usersâ€™ contributions to the community during the week. As the website and community grow, additional sources begin to contribute tokens to the weekly reward pool. Such sources can be fees for the ads and job postings published on the website, donations, or other ways that the community decides to monetize the website. The rate of new token creation reduces every year and eventually decreases to zero. At this point, the weekly reward pool will solely consist of tokens monetized by the website.

### What Blockchain Peeranha is built on?

Peeranha is powered by TELOS blockchain. TELOS provides short confirmation times for transactions and does not require users to pay any transaction fees.

### What is the cryptocurrency of Peeranha?

Peeranha uses its own crypto-token (or cryptocurrency) called PEER.

### Are my keys safe if sign up with email?

- The second copy is encrypted using your Master key and used to recover access to the account in case if you forget the password.

**It is very important to save Master Key in a safe place. We will not be able to restore access to your account if Master Key is lost.**

When access account, encrypted keys are sent to application and decrypted inside the application using your password or Master Key.

## Token

### What is the name of Peeranha token?

Token name is PEER

### Is it listed on any exchange?

No, PEER is not listed on any exchange yet. We will notify the community as soon as this happens.

### What is total supply?

Total supply of PEER token is 100,000,000 PEER

### What is token allocation?

* 60% of PEER will be created by emission and used as initial rewards to users for the contributions
* 20% founders and team rewards
* 20% funding

### What is emission rate?

New tokens are created once per week when it is time to reward users. Maximum starting emission is 300,000 PEER per week. Emission is reduced by 10% every 52 weeks.

## Rewards

### When rewards are paid out?

Rewards are paid out weekly, starting from Peeranha launch date on December 17th, 2019.
To prevent abuse of the system, there a safety period of one additional week before rewards are available for users to be received. For example, estimated rewards for week 1 will be visible after beginning of week 2 but available to be received only after the beginning of week 3.

### How user rewards are calculated?

The maximum size of the weekly reward pool is equal to maximum weekly emission of the token. However, it depends on the user activity during that period.

If total rating points earned by all of the users during the week and multiplied by 10 is less than maximum token emission that reward is simply 10 PEER per rating point. Otherwise reward pool size is equal to maximum weekly token emission and tokens are distributed proportionally to rating points earned by users.
